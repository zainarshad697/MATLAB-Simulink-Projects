## 🎯 Objective  
To practice modeling a simple signal-processing system and understand Simulink's visual simulation workflow.

---

## ⚙️ Components Used  
- Sine Wave Generator  
- Gain Block (set to 3)  
- Scope (for output visualization)

---

## 📊 Output  
The result is a sine wave scaled by a factor of 3, as seen in the Scope output.
