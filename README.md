# Simple Sine Wave Amplifier in Simulink

This project is a basic simulation using Simulink where a sine wave is amplified using a Gain block and visualized using a Scope.

# Objective

To practice modeling a simple signal-processing system and understand Simulink's visual simulation workflow.

# Components Used

- Sine Wave Generator  
- Gain Block (set to 3)  
- Scope (for output visualization)

# Output

The result is a sine wave scaled by a factor of 3, as seen in the Scope output.

# File

- `Simple_Simulink_Model.slx`

# Notes

This model was created as part of my learning process in Simulink, using basic block connections and signal visualization.  
It marks the beginning of my modeling journey and will be followed by more complex projects as I explore Simscape and control systems.
